# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Focus Training Academy is a gamified web platform designed to help adults develop sustained focus skills through science-driven micro-lessons, personalized challenges, and AI-powered coaching. The platform differentiates itself from meditation apps (Headspace), habit trackers (Habitica), and brain training games (Elevate) by combining neuroscience-based training with real-time AI coaching and biometric feedback for measurable attention improvement.

**Target Market:** Initially targeting knowledge workers and students (B2C), with expansion to corporate wellness programs and educational institutions (B2B).

**Monetization Strategy:** Freemium model with basic challenges free, premium individual subscriptions ($9.99/month), and enterprise packages ($5/user/month for organizations 50+).

**Unique Value Proposition:** The only platform that teaches sustainable focus as a learnable skill through adaptive AI coaching, real-time biometric feedback, and science-backed progressive training methodology.
